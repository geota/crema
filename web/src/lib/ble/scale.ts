/**
 * `$lib/ble/scale` — Web Bluetooth manager for a Bookoo coffee scale.
 *
 * The web mirror of the Android shell's `ScaleBleManager`. A close sibling of
 * {@link De1Manager}. Responsibilities:
 *  1. `requestDevice()` for a scale (name-prefix filter), connect GATT, and
 *     tell the core which scale it is via `core.connectScale(name)` so the
 *     core selects the right codec.
 *  2. Ask the core for the scale's GATT UUIDs (`core.scaleUuids()`) — unlike
 *     the DE1, the scale's UUIDs are **not** hardcoded in the shell; the core
 *     knows them per scale model.
 *  3. `startNotifications()` on the weight-notify characteristic
 *     (→ `ScaleWeight`) and, when distinct, the command characteristic
 *     (→ `ScaleCommand`, the Bookoo's `ff12` serial / settings responses).
 *  4. Trigger `core.scaleCapabilities()` + `core.queryScaleSettings()` so the
 *     orchestrator can drive capability-gated config UI.
 *  5. Expose {@link writeScale} for `Command.WriteScale` command bytes.
 *
 * Web Bluetooth needs every service it will touch declared up front in
 * `optionalServices`. The scale UUIDs come from `core.scaleUuids()` — but
 * `requestDevice` runs *before* the core has identified the scale, so
 * `optionalServices` lists the known Bookoo service UUID. After connecting,
 * the core-reported UUIDs drive the actual subscriptions.
