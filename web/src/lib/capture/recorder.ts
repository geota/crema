/**
 * `$lib/capture/recorder` — capture-entry shape + the JSONL download
 * serializer. Once a thick rolling-buffer / identity-keeper / META-prelude
 * implementation, now type-only — the rolling buffer, the per-source
 * identity dictionary, and the META construction all live in the Rust core
 * (`core/de1-app/src/capture.rs`) and are reached via the wasm bridge's
 * `captureSliceJsonl`. Pushed there so the web shell and Android share one
 * byte-for-byte implementation, and so the recorder side-effect rides the
 * same wasm boundary crossing as the decode rather than adding a second one.
 *
 * Two surfaces survive on this side:
 *  - {@link CaptureEntry} — the JSONL line shape that IndexedDB (`./store`)
 *    structured-clones and the {@link captureJsonl} helper serialises. Used
 *    by `ShotDetail.svelte`'s download path.
 *  - {@link captureJsonl} — the JSONL-line serializer for the download.
 *    The slice is built by `CremaCore.captureSliceJsonl` (which already
 *    returns JSONL bytes); this helper exists only for the post-load
 *    download path, where the IndexedDB read returns a `CaptureEntry[]`
 *    and the user clicks "Download" to save it.
