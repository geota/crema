/**
 * `$lib/history/store` — the shot-history store.
 *
 * Backs the `/history` library: the list of past shots, their stored curves,
 * and the editable tasting-notes / star rating. Crema's web shell is a static,
 * client-only PWA — there is no server — so `localStorage` is the store, the
 * same choice (and the shared `$lib/utils/storage` helpers) the profile
 * library makes.
 *
 * Records arrive one way: the orchestrator calls {@link HistoryStore.record}
 * from its `ShotCompleted` handler with a snapshot of the just-finished shot
 * (see `lib/state/app.svelte.ts`). The page only ever *reads* the list and
 * edits notes / ratings — it never fabricates shots, so an untouched install
 * shows a genuine empty state.
 *
 * The store is a Svelte 5 `$state` class; obtain the singleton with
 * {@link getHistoryStore}. It loads synchronously from `localStorage`.
