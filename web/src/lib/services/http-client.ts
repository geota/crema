/**
 * `#lib/services/http-client.js` — the Visualizer HTTP client service (docs/53
 * §1.3, T-09).
 *
 * Wraps `fetch` and turns its two failure modes into typed errors:
 *  - the fetch promise rejecting (offline, DNS, CORS) → `NetworkError`
 *  - a non-2xx response → `HttpStatusError` (carrying status + body so callers
 *    can branch: 401 → refresh, 402/403 → premium-gated, …)
 *
 * No retries here (those live in `UploadQueue`). The fetch is wired to the
 * fiber's `AbortSignal`, so an interrupt or timeout actually cancels the
 * in-flight request — mirroring today's `AbortSignal.timeout(…)` usage.
 *
 * Timeout is **opt-in per request** (`timeoutMs`), not a global default. The
 * webhook fan-out sets 5 s and the OAuth token requests 30 s; `visualizerCall`
 * bounds a whole Visualizer call (fetch plus body read) at 60 s itself.
