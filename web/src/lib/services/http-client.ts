/**
 * `$lib/services/http-client` — the Visualizer HTTP client service (docs/53
 * §1.3, T-09).
 *
 * Wraps `fetch` and turns its two failure modes into typed errors:
 *  - the fetch promise rejecting (offline, DNS, CORS) → `NetworkError`
 *  - a non-2xx response → `HttpStatusError` (carrying status + body so callers
 *    can branch: 401 → refresh, 402/403 → premium-gated, …)
 *
 * No retries here (those live in `UploadQueue`). The fetch is wired to the
 * fiber's `AbortSignal`, so an interrupt or timeout actually cancels the
 * in-flight request — mirroring today's `AbortSignal.timeout(…)` usage.
 *
 * Timeout is **opt-in per request** (`timeoutMs`), not a global default: the
 * only caller that times out today is the webhook fan-out (5 s). Shot uploads
 * currently have no timeout, and imposing one here would be a silent behavior
 * change when this client is wired into ShotSync (T-12).
